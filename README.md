# Simple-Fibanacci-Using-Multiprocessing

I've just started the concurrency and parallelism programming using Python :) and this is the first quick project that crossed my mind.
As you may know, the Fibonacci problem has many solutions. In this code I used dynamic programming approach to do so and the time complexity
of this program is **O(n)**.
